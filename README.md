Two code samples are provided here. One is using Python, the other one is using front end tools for interactive data visualization of class discussion topics.

### 1, python (python 2.7): https://github.com/qjin2016/code_sample/blob/master/python_sample.md

The code is intented to connect to a MSSQL server on Amazon Web Service (AWS), query data (temperature) that was recorded within a specified time interval and generate line plots.

### 2, interactive data visualization: https://github.com/qjin2016/code_sample/tree/master/web

The link contains an interactive data visualization tool built on top of HTML, CSS, jQuery and d3.js. This tool is currently accessible online: http://students.washington.edu/jinqu/viz_discussion/web/
